# HR Management System Migration Plan: From Flask to Frappe/ERPNext

## Overview
This document outlines the migration plan for transitioning our HR Management System from the current Flask/PostgreSQL stack to Frappe/ERPNext framework. The migration will be completed in phases to ensure minimal disruption to existing functionality.

## Objectives
- Migrate all HR functions to Frappe/ERPNext's structured framework
- Maintain data integrity during migration
- Implement proper Frappe DocTypes for all modules
- Enhance functionality using Frappe's built-in features
- Enable seamless transition for users

## Migration Approach
We've chosen a progressive migration approach with compatibility layers to ensure the system remains functional throughout the transition.

### Phase 1: Structure and Compatibility Layer ✓
- Set up Frappe compatibility layer in Flask application
- Create the proper Frappe-style directory structure
- Create empty package files and module structure
- Implement basic hooks system for event handling

### Phase 2: Core Modules Migration ✓
- Migrate Employee module to Frappe DocType format
- Implement Attendance tracking with proper validations
- Convert Leave Applications and Leave Types
- Create Frappe-style APIs for each module

### Phase 3: Complex Modules Migration ⚠️ (In Progress)
- Migrate Payroll module (Salary Structure and Salary Slip)
- Convert Recruitment modules (Job Opening and Job Applicant)
- Implement Performance Appraisal system
- Set up notifications and messaging system

### Phase 4: User Interface and Experience 🔄
- Implement Frappe UI templates
- Create consistent web views for public-facing pages
- Set up role-based dashboards
- Enable Frappe's desk interface for administrators

### Phase 5: Data Migration and Testing 📋
- Migrate existing data to new structure
- Test all functionality end-to-end
- Run parallel systems temporarily
- Fix any data inconsistencies

### Phase 6: Deployment and Handover 📅
- Switch to the complete Frappe system
- Decommission old Flask endpoints
- Train users on new interfaces
- Document the new system architecture

## Current Progress

### Completed
- ✓ Created compatibility layer between Flask and Frappe
- ✓ Set up proper Frappe directory structure
- ✓ Implemented Employee DocType with validations
- ✓ Created Attendance and Leave Application DocTypes
- ✓ Developed Salary Structure and Salary Slip DocTypes
- ✓ Added basic templates for web views
- ✓ Implemented Job Opening and Job Applicant DocTypes

### In Progress
- 🔄 Converting remaining modules to Frappe format
- 🔄 Enhancing API layer for third-party integrations
- 🔄 Creating supporting DocTypes for child tables
- 🔄 Setting up proper web routes for public pages

### Pending
- 📋 Data migration from PostgreSQL to MariaDB
- 📋 Implementation of Frappe desk interface
- 📋 Full UI implementation of dashboards
- 📋 Setup of automated workflows
- 📋 Testing and validation of all modules

## Technical Stack Transition
| Component | Current (Flask) | Target (Frappe) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Framework | Flask          | Frappe/ERPNext  |
| Database  | PostgreSQL     | MariaDB/MySQL   |
| ORM       | SQLAlchemy     | Frappe ORM      |
| UI        | Bootstrap      | Frappe UI/Desk  |
| Authentication | Flask-Login | Frappe User System |
| API       | Custom Flask   | Frappe REST API |
| Templates | Jinja2         | Jinja2 (Frappe) |
| Assets    | Static files   | Frappe Assets   |

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Different Database Systems
**Solution:** Use Frappe's data import/export tools to migrate data from PostgreSQL to MariaDB.

### Challenge 2: Authentication Differences
**Solution:** Implement a temporary authentication bridge that works with both systems.

### Challenge 3: Different ORM Paradigms
**Solution:** Create adapter classes that translate between SQLAlchemy and Frappe ORM calls.

### Challenge 4: UI/UX Transition
**Solution:** Gradually introduce Frappe UI components while maintaining a consistent experience.

### Challenge 5: Complex Business Logic
**Solution:** Break down complex functions into smaller, testable units and migrate them incrementally.

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Rollback Plan:** Maintain ability to revert to Flask system if critical issues emerge
2. **Feature Freezes:** Implement temporary freezes on feature development during critical migrations
3. **Parallel Testing:** Run both systems simultaneously during testing phases
4. **User Training:** Provide comprehensive training on new interfaces and workflows
5. **Documentation:** Maintain detailed documentation of all changes and new architecture

## Timeline
- **Phase 1:** 2 weeks (Complete)
- **Phase 2:** 3 weeks (Complete)
- **Phase 3:** 4 weeks (In Progress - Week 2)
- **Phase 4:** 3 weeks
- **Phase 5:** 2 weeks
- **Phase 6:** 2 weeks

Total estimated time: 16 weeks

## Responsible Team
- Lead Developer: Responsible for overall architecture and migration strategy
- Backend Developer: Focus on database migration and business logic
- Frontend Developer: Implement UI changes and user experience
- QA Tester: Ensure functionality works as expected in both systems
- Project Manager: Coordinate efforts and maintain timeline

## Conclusion
This migration will significantly improve the HR Management System by leveraging Frappe/ERPNext's robust framework. The gradual migration approach ensures business continuity while enabling us to take advantage of Frappe's extensive features and community support.
